# Syllogistic

This program determines whether a given syllogistic argument is valid; it currently also contains sub-functions that determine whether a proposition is positive or negative, and also functions that determine the distributed terms in a proposition.
I also plan on expanding this code with functionality for performing immediate inferences, and (more speculatively), machinery for modal syllogistic.

Notation:

"PaQ" =df. "All Ps are Qs"
"PeQ" =df. "No Ps are Qs"
"PiQ" =df. "Some Ps are Qs"
"PoQ" =df. "Some Ps are not Qs"

For this program, you will be prompted to input categorical propositions (2 premises and a conclusion) using the notation outlined above. The program will then tell you whether the argument is valid, and if not, what fallacy it commits.
