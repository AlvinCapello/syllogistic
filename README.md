# Syllogistic

This program determines whether a given syllogistic argument is valid (it currently also contains sub-functions that determine whether a proposition is positive or negative, and also functions that determine the distributed terms in a proposition.
I also plan on expanding this code with functionality for performing immediate inferences, and (more speculatively), machinery for modal syllogistic.
